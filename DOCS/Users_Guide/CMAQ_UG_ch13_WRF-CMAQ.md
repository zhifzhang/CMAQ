# 13. WRF-CMAQ Model

## 13.1 Introduction
Air quality models are typically run in two different ways:
* Standalone – Archived output from a meteorological model is used to drive the air quality model.
* Coupled – The air quality and meteorological models are run simultaneously and the chemistry can impact the weather.

The latter “coupled” method is beneficial for studying important interactions between present of aerosol and weather. For example, aerosols can affect the amount of sunlight that reaches the surface, thus impacting temperature (aerosol direct effect). Aerosols also have important impacts on cloud formation (aerosol indirect effect) and cloud albedo. CMAQ has been coupled to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for this purpose with the emphasis on aerosol direct effect. In addition, meteorological information is passing to CMAQ in a high frequency than standalone mode. 

In the WRF-CMAQ model (Wong et al., 2012), WRF and CMAQ are simultaneously integrated and information from CMAQ, like aerosol concentration, is passed into WRF so that the presence of aerosols can impact the weather. Specifically, the WRF-CMAQ model gives users the options to pass aerosol optical properties to the radiation modules in WRF (aerosol direct radiative effects).  The ability to pass aerosol information into the cloud microphysics routines (aerosol indirect effects; Yu et al, 2014) is currently under development and will be available in a future release.   

## 13.2 Aerosol Direct Radiative Feedback Effects
Aerosol information from CMAQ is transferred to the meteorological model, WRF.  Wavelength dependent aerosol optical properties (extinction, single scattering albedo, and asymmetry factor) are estimated using aerosol composition and size distribution information simulated by CMAQ in conjunction with an algorithm based on Mie theory.  Black carbon is treated by the core-shell approach developed by Frank Binkowski based on Bohren and Huffman (1983). This has been implemented in the shortwave Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for General Circulation Models (RRTMG) radiation scheme in WRF, where aerosol optical properties are calculated for 14 wavelength bands (Clough et al. 2005). The aerosol optics calculations in the WRF-CMAQ model were assessed through comparison to measured optical properties of ambient aerosols made during the Carbonaceous Aerosol and Radiation Effects Study (CARES) as detailed by Gan et al. (2015a).

## 13.3 Application and Evaluation 
The ability of the WRF-CMAQ system to reproduce historical trends in the tropospheric aerosol burden, aerosol optical depths, and clear-sky short wave radiation across the northern hemisphere and the U.S., has recently been assessed through extensive comparisons of long-term simulations of these quantities with observation-derived records from 1990 to 2010 (Xing et al. 2015a,b; Gan et al., 2015b). The model captured declining Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) trends along with the corresponding decreased top-of-atmosphere (TOA) short-wave radiation (SWR), or  upwelling, and increased surface SWR, or downwelling, in the eastern US, Europe and the northern Atlantic for the period of 2000–2010. Estimates of the aerosol direct radiative effects (ADE) at TOA were comparable with those derived from measurements and, compared to general circulation models, the model exhibited better estimates of surface-aerosol direct radiative efficiency (Eτ) (Xing et al., 2015b).

Additionally, top-of-atmosphere clear-sky shortwave radiation during 2000-2010, inferred from the NASA Cloud and Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) satellite retrievals show decreasing trends in the eastern U.S. and increasing trends in eastern China. The inclusion of ADE in WRF-CMAQ yielded better agreement with these contrasting trends suggesting that the trends in clear-sky radiation are influenced by trends in the tropospheric aerosol burden.

Impacts of aerosol cooling are not limited to changes in surface temperature, since variation in atmospheric dynamics caused by the increased stability can worsen local air quality and impact human health.

Hemispheric WRF-CMAQ model simulation over two decades (1990−2010) shows enhanced surface PM2.5 concentrations in the most polluted regions of the world due to the aerosol direct effect.


## 13.4 Latest WRF-CMAQ Release

The new WRF-CMAQ model is based on WRFv4.1.1 and CMAQv5.3.2. It supports only RRTMG radiation scheme for short wave aerosol direct effect. It uses core-shell model to perform aerosol optics calculations rather than volume mixing technique as in the previous version of the WRF-CMAQ model. 

The code used to prepare the WRFv4.1.1-CMAQv5.3.2 model is released as a tarball (WRFv4.1.1-CMAQv5.3.2_twoway.tar.gz) from the CMAS Center Data Warehouse Google Drive.
- [Link to WRFv4.1.1-CMAQv5.3.2 Model on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oZecf-4aRu9q0ZptNsyI63QU4KUrTFFl/view?usp=sharing)

Build and run instructions are provided in the top level **readme** file in the tarball and also in the [WRF-CMAQ Tutorial](Tutorials/CMAQ_UG_tutorial_WRF-CMAQ_build_gcc.md).

## 13.5 Benchmarking WRF-CMAQ

Benchmark input and output datasets are available from the CMAS Center Data Warehouse Google Drive.  Beginning with CMAQv5.3.1, the .tar.gz file with benchmark inputs for the base (uncoupled) model also contains a folder (WRF-CMAQ) with the additional input files needed to run the WRF-CMAQ model and sample WRF-CMAQ runscripts (run.twoway_model_411_532_sf_run_script.16pe.csh) to run with short-wave radiation calculations and run.twoway_model_411_532_sf_run_script.16pe.csh to run without feedback).  Similarly, the .tar.gz file with benchmark output for the base model also contains a folder (WRFv4.1.1_CMAQv5.3.2_outputs) with reference output for the WRF-CMAQ model with short-wave radiation calculations (files ending with "sf.nc") and without short-wave radiation (files ending with "nf.nc").  These input and output benchmark files have also been posted on the US EPA annoymous ftp server.

- WRF-CMAQ Benchmark input and output datasets on EPA annoymous ftp server: https://gaftp.epa.gov/exposure/CMAQ/V5_3_1/Benchmark

WRF-CMAQ output for a two day benchmark case is provided for both the debug mode turned off (.tar.gz files containing "opt") and the debug mode turned on (.tar.gz files containing "rel_debug") version to allow the user to compare their answers to either. To reduce the impact of compiler flags on the model output, it is preferrable to use the debug version. To compare model results obtained while achieving faster run times due to compiler optimization, the Optimized version output is also provided.

Metadata for the CMAQ benchmark test case is posted on the CMAS Center Dataverse site: https://doi.org/10.15139/S3/IQVABD 

Once users have successfully completed installation and users can run a quick test to ensure model installation was truly successful. Users can setup a run base on the provided run script and a benchmark input dataset. Users should consult with the readme file which was accompanied by the test dataset or the release documentation to use the appropriate compiler flags for this quick test. Once the stimulation is completed, users can compare the newly produced result with the provided benchmark output. The comparison should return identical result if users have the same compiler version and system environment. This quick test gives users a peace of mind that the model installation was truly successful.

Users should note, comparing the results of running WRF-CMAQ with the given input to the results of running CMAQ (offline) with the given input, while on the same domain, will include differences from other sources other than just the coupling of WRF and CMAQ. These differences are due to the version and nudging of WRF used to generate input files for CMAQ (offline) through MCIP, as well as the effect of windowing down to the south-east benchmark from the CONUS done for the CMAQ (offline) case.
