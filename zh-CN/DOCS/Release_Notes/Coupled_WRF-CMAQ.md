# WRF-CMAQ Coupled Model

## Brief Description
The new coupled WRF-CMAQ model which is based on WRF 4.1.1 and CMAQ 5.3, is an online meteorology-chemistry model that simulates the two-way feedback between meteorology and chemistry. The feedback focuses on the interactions of estimated aerosol mass on incoming shortwave radiation.  More information about the coupled model is provided in [Chapter 13 of the User's Guide](../Users_Guide/CMAQ_UG_ch13_WRF-CMAQ.md).
