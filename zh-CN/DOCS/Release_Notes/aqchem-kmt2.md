# AQCHEM-KMT2: Extended Inorganic and Organic Cloud Chemistry using the Kinetic PreProcessor

[Kathleen M. Fahey](mailto:fahey.kathleen@epa.gov), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

## Brief Description

This is an updated version of AQCHEM-KMT(I) (Fahey et al., 2017) that was built using the Kinetic PreProcessor v2.2.3 (Damian et al., 2002).
It builds upon CMAQ's existing in-cloud S oxidation chemistry and replaces the yield parameterization of in-cloud SOA formation from GLY/MGLY+OH with the more mechanistic representation of small dicarboxylic acid formation from the reactions of OH with glyoxal, methylglyoxal, glycolaldehyde, and acetic acid (Lim et al., 2005; Lim et al., 2010, 2013; Sareen et al., 2013). It also includes additional aqueous chemistry for S, N, C, and O-H species based on the aqueous mechanism of ReLACS-AQ (Leriche et al., 2013), which is a reduced cloud chemistry mechanism built from and tested against more extensive models.

## Significance and Impact

The species impacted and magnitude of effect depend heavily on season and domain. Previous simulations over the Eastern U.S. during June 2013 using CMAQv5.2 showed a surface-level increase in in-cloud SOA from small carbonyl compounds (AORGC) of 150-300+% compared to CMAQ's standard yield-based parameterization for GLY and MGLY+OH.  While the June 2013 average AORGC was <0.2&nbsp;&#956;g&nbsp;m<sup>&#8209;3</sup>, max hourly change reached 3&nbsp;&#956;g&nbsp;m<sup>&#8209;3</sup>. KMT2 shows elevated cloud SOA at the surface and aloft. For the June 2013 simulation, AORGC made up ~2&#8209;6% of average surface SOA over much of the Eastern U.S., with the percentage increasing aloft. A recent hemispheric simulation showed monthly average changes in in-cloud SOA up to ~1&nbsp;&#956;g&nbsp;m<sup>&#8209;3</sup> in regions/seasons where oxidant levels and biogenic emissions were high and increased by at least a factor of 5 in much of the SE U.S. 

In the winter, sulfate seems to be the most significantly impacted species. Recent hemispheric simulations for January 2016 saw a monthly average SO<sub>4</sub> increase of up to 17% in China and up to 34% in the United States. Nitrate decreased with a similar pattern to SO<sub>4</sub> increase. Monthly average O<sub>3</sub>, HCHO, and NO<sub>x</sub> saw small impacts over CONUS (typically within ~3%), but one can see larger absolute impacts over shorter time periods and in other regions (e.g., change in average O<sub>3</sub> up to -11% in Asia). 

Impacts on CMAQ runtime also depend heavily on domain, season, and chemical mechanism, and they can be ~20-30% for some hemispheric applications, increasing from there.
