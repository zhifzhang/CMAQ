********************************************************************************
Announcing the release of MCIP Version 5.1 (25 November 2019)
********************************************************************************

The MCIP code is updated to version 5.1.  This is a minor update to MCIP.
These release notes and the CHANGES file reflect all changes that have been
made to MCIP since MCIPv5.0 (the previous release).  Changes to MCIPv5.1
were made by Tanya Spero (U.S. EPA).

MCIPv5.1 accompanies CMAQv5.3.1.  If you are using CMAQv5.3+, you should upgrade
to use MCIPv5.0+.

MCIPv5.0 requires I/O API version 3.1 or greater to support error-checking
within the I/O API.

MCIPv5.0 requires the netCDF F90 module (rather than the F77 include).

A DOI will also be available for CMAQv5.3.1 (which includes MCIPv5.1).

Inquiries related to potential bugs in MCIPv5.1 or questions related to
proper use of the code should be submitted to the MCIP Category in the
Forum hosted by the CMAS Center:  https://forum.cmascenter.org/c/mcip.

Users are encouraged to read the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) file.
Users should consult the FAQ and other issues raised within the Forum
before submitting new inquiries.



MCIPv5.0 was tested with the following Fortran compilers under both debug
and optimized options at various stages of development:  Intel 18.0, PGI 17.10,
and GCC 6.0.1.  MCIPv5.0 was tested with netCDF 4.6.3, and I/O API 3.2.


With MCIPv5.1, the following remain deprecated:
  - Including "SOIM1", "SOIM2", "SOIT1", and "SOIT2" in METCRO2D.
    Those fields are now in a separate file that includes all soil layers and
    their associated depths (SOI_CRO).
  - Including "LUFRAC_xx" in GRIDCRO2D.  Those fields are now in a separate
    file that includes each fractional land use classification (LUFRAC_CRO).

With MCIPv5.1, the following output variables in METCRO2D remain deprecated:
     - 2-D cloud fraction (CFRAC)
     - cloud top (CLDT)
     - cloud bottom (CLDB)
     - liquid water content (WBAR)
They will be removed from METCRO2D in a forthcoming release of MCIP.


Interactions with members of the CMAQ user community led to some of the changes
that have been incorporated into MCIPv5.1.


The following is a summary of the changes in MCIPv5.1:

 1.  Corrected an error in the MCIP script that interfered with reading
     Geogrid files (introduced in MCIPv5.0).

 2.  Corrected an error in filling the lateral boundaries of the WWIND and
     CFRAC3D fields when CFRAC3D is available (introduced in MCIPv5.0).

 3.  Added support for processing surface FDDA fields generated with FASDAS
     in WRF.
